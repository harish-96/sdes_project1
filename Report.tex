\section{Introduction}

This report is a part of the submission for a course project on Van der Pol oscillator in the course on Software Development Tools for Engineers and Scientists. The code to solve the equations is written in Python programming language.
The Van der Pol oscillator is a non-conservative oscillator with non-linear damping. It evolves according to the second order linear differential equation
$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \mu(1 - x^2)\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0$
where x is the position coordinate -- which is a function of time t, and \mu is a scalar parameter indicating non linearity in the strength of the damping.

\section{Results}

The following plots have been obtained solving the differential equation with the initial condition %add ics and mu

\section{Installation Instructions}

The following are the dependencies, please refer to the well documented installation instructions for these online:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Python 3 or above
	\item Numpy
	\item Scipy
	\item Matplotlib
\end{itemize}

With these installed, go to the download directory and in the bash terminal, type make.
To edit the parameters of the Van der Pol oscillator, make changes to the input.csv file in the required columns.
